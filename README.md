# MacroTracker Android App

## App for tracking dietary macros, written in Python and Kivy.
---
This app has input boxes for Kcals, Fats, Carbohydrates and Proteins.
1. Input your macros and press the ADD button. This adds the data to a sqlite3 database. 
2. Press TOTAL ALL to display totals in all fields.
3. The SUB button removes the last set of information you have input to remove a mistake, etc.
4. The CLEAR button deletes all data from the database ie: starts a new day.

This needs to be compiled to .APK with Buildozer to run on an android device. Details here : [Buildozer](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

Feel free to clone, fork etc.
